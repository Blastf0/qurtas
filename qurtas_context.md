# Guiding the consumption of literature 📖

This idea is part of my "book review" app that would act as a companion to readers of literature. Reading can be difficult to pick up, and even experienced readers might find it troublesome to absorb a book, or continue reading it.

The idea is to create a counselor of sorts that helps people pick what to read (based on their outcome goals, preferences, and reading level), digest and better understand what they read, critically analyze texts (this will include non-fiction and technical books), engage in discussion with other readers.

Audiobooks should be included in this discussion. Should AI generated text also be included..? NotebookLLM and ChatBot summaries are a step into consolidating literature, but what about AI_Generated original content?

Reading better - not more

Users can create syllabi that enable them to acquire a solid understanding of a topic. They use the platform to help them create the syllabus, and through back and forth conversation arrive at a suitable roadmap

The platform helps users complete books by arranging a “journey” of reading. Using data from other users, or preferences of the users, the platform reccomends how much to read, when to take a break, and when to do external research on a topic if needed for completion.

### Why Reading

In my own journey reading literature, I have come to appreciate the staying power of written text. Being able to absorb - truly absorb - the content of a book was far more impactful for me as a student than watching a thousand explanations through video format. This appreciation deepened when reading became more than just an academic endeavor, especially due to the distraction of short form content proliferating in entertainment.

**In short, I think books and written content are the supreme medium for information exchange, and I want to see this idea proliferate across people in my generation.** 

### The Problem

Reading as a hobby and as a method of learning is declining [unqualified]. Increasingly, short form content and video based content are replacing education and entertainment, causing a sharp decline in reading comprehension and literacy. This phenomenon is exasperated by the proliferation of short form content, which has replaced many pass times (doomscrolling) with little benefit or achievement to show for it.

### The Hypothesis

It is my belief that this decline in reading is not a result of disinterest, lack of appreciation, or general dislike of reading on the part of the younger generation. On the contrary, I believe there is a strong desire that people have in picking up reading, and that there is ample opportunity to capitalize on that desire.

The way I see it, reading is not being picked up at the appropriate volume because of the proliferation of entertainment and short form content. The portal of the smartphone makes boredom a scarce resource, which reduces the enthusiasm of picking up reading as a hobby. However, when asked if they wish to become readers, most people will answer with a strong yes, citing time constraints and difficulty in finding relevant books as main barriers for entry. 

Because the pleasure and benefits of reading are non-immediate, and require significant commitment to show significance, there is an opportunity to increase reading engagement by “deabstracting” the reading process. By streamlining the discovery, consumption, discussion, and internalization of literature (whether done for pleasure or work), the process of reading can become appealing enough to compete with other sources of attention in the digital age. Furthermore, formalizing the reading process can assist established readers in “getting more” out of their experience (insight into what they were reading, keeping track of their reading journey).

### The Goals

In line with the hypothesis laid above. I see three broad goals that Litra should fulfill as a platform at this time. They are : 

- **Encourage increased reading engagement**

The platform should equip users to engage more frequently with literature in a meaningful manner. Making reading a routine habit is not enough; users should also be reading content that is relevant, impactful, and well written. 

- **Assist in reading comprehension and internalization**

When engaging in reading, users should be able to access a wide range of contexts in order to better assess the content of what they are reading. Users should be enabled in achieving higher levels of reading comprehension, and more deeply internalize the content they read. 

- **Improve the outcomes of reading activities**

Reading should be a continuous and iterative activity, moved forward by the sense of accomplishment and self-enrichment. In this respect, the platform should encourage active and continuous engagement by highlighting these outcomes of achievement to the reader.

### Features

Discovering literature to read - A peripheral focus of the platform should be in literature discovery. This ranges from low-frequency events like book recommendations, to high frequency events like news briefings. Users can explore books to add to their catalogues, or be introduced to news publications that cover topics they are interested in.  The discovery process should be user-led, and the user should feel like the recommendations contain their inputs. This way, the user feels a stronger attachment to those reccomendations as opposed to being suggested something in passing (i.e in a similiar manner to tik tok or social media)

Reading journey fellowship and assistance - A core offering of the platform will be in ‘accompanying’ users along their reading journey. This can be thought of as a log of the users progress through a book, with each reading session constituting a ‘new page’ in that log. The user jogs down brief post-reading notes that can be used to refresh their memory for new reading sessions, better seat new ideas, and be used for future recommendations and guidance. In between sessions, users can review their progress and write down notes, features that increase the likelyhood of them returning for a new reading session. I want this to feel like an ecosystem that is intricately designed to make the habit of reading as frictionless as possible, and maximize the returns from engaging with literature.

Rereading completed texts - Once a user completes a book, the title should be open for future rereads. This is a repeat of the reading journey fellowship, with the added benefit of comparing annotations, notes and markings across the different sessions. 

Reflections on completed literature - For books and self-contained pieces of literature, there should be an ultimate debriefing when the user finally completes (or drops) the article of literature. This is a feature that works alongside the post-reading reviews, and serves to improve future recommendations, concretely define outcomes from the readings for user convenience, and adjust the journey fellowship based on user preferences. We want to understand why users complete some books, but drop others.

Discussing literature with other readers - This is a stretch goal for now, however the platform should entice discussions on literature for deeper understanding and exploration. This could be somewhat similar to how chinese novel apps open discussion on a passage by passage basis, which opens discussion on events that occur in the novel but keeps them focused to in the moment. This would work great for fictional novels, and is simpler to implement than a full fledged discussion board (?).
